<p>
    All dogs are microchippped, neutered, current on allvaccines,
    heartworm tested (if age appropriate) and up to date on
    preventatives at the time of adoption.

    All household members and any dogs from the household need to be
    present at the time of your appointment. Photo ID will be required
    at time of adoption.

    The shelter is currently open by appointment only with an approved
    application. Please note, all applications are considered general
    and stay on file for 6 months. Specific animals are NOT put on
    hold for adoption. When you visit, the adoption counselors will be
    able to make suggestions based on the type of pet you are looking
    for and help you find the best fit for your family.

    Animal House Shelter cannot guarantee the breeds of the adoptable
    animals. The animals are posted on the website as the breed or
    breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most
    resemble. We also cannot guarantee the ages of our adoptable
    animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.

    We look forward to seeing you soon!
